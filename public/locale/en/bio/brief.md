## **A voice rising from the ashes of war.**

Ebo Krdum is a Sudanese-Swedish self-taught singer, guitarist, artist, actor and activist. He creates contemporary political afro-blues & afrobeat music rooted in several musical traditions around the sub-Saharan area (in his current projects). Ebo sings in many different languages and his lyrics mostly contain topics such as justice, peace, freedom, equality, diversity, revolution and liberty.

When Ebo was only six years old he discovered that he could sing and drum with his bare hands and he started entertaining people in his village, where he’d sometimes got paid with a small penny or sweets. At the age of thirteen he built his own guitar and learned how to play through his father’s radio and the only black-white TV in the village, where he got to hear artists such as Ali Farka Touré and Boubacar Traoré. Later in life Ebo also learned how to play other instruments such as Gojo, Ngoni, Oud, Tamboor, drums, keyboard and wood-flute.

When the war started in Darfur in 2003 Ebo became an important voice for the peaceful revolution against the corrupt and violent regime. Beside his musical participation in the situation, he was also active in a huge activism for the opposition that aimed to overthrow the dictatorship in Sudan, which was also the reason why he was forced to flee the country. Ebo is now based in Stockholm, Sweden, where he has established himself as one of the most prominent world music acts on the music-scene. Here in Sweden he has also started his own band at the end of 2017, combined of 7-seven musicians.

Today, Ebo and his band have 11-eleven songs released in both EP and singles forms. They were all from Ebo’s project (Memory of War).

In September 2021 Ebo will release his first solo album 'Diversity' on Sweden’s most interesting label 'Supertraditional'. The album Diversity is from Ebo’s project named The Sub-Saharan Jigs. He will also start a new collaboration soon with the well-known music organization Selam.
