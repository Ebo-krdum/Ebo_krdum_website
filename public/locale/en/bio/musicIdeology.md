## **Musical ideology**

Ebo’s musical ideology is: Always stand with poor’s side, keep creating awareness on issues that needs to be lifted up, never underestimate the power of words and music in creating change, always support the oppressed, vulnerable and marginalized people and populations and always choose the nonviolence as a solution for conflicts and problems.

**_Quoting Ebo:_** _As an artist i have my commitments towards populations/nations, just like any other savior, warner or decision maker in any community, so I’m committed to speak the truth, to represent those who need me to put out their words and to cry out their suffering and pain, because I’m responsible of taking action and fighting with my lyrics, voice and hands against whatever evil I see, hear or feel around the smaller communities and up to the whole world. Because one day, after I die I will at least have an answer for history when history asks me : what did I do with what I’ve got under the period of the life I’ve been given?_
