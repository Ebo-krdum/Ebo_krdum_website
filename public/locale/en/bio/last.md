## **Last words**

Real revolutionaries don’t sleep, don’t quit and never give up until they achieve what they started, if not in their time and generation may it be a seed for new and upcoming generations. Where they will be mentioned and remembered as history will not forget and will never forgive. May justice, change, peace & love cover the whole world one day!
