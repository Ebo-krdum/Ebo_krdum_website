        Real revolutionaries don’t sleep, don’t quit and never give up until
        they achieve what they started, if not in their time and generation may
        it be a seed for new and upcoming generations. Where they will be
        mentioned and remembered as history will not forget and will never
        forgive. May justice, change, peace & love cover the whole world one
        day!
